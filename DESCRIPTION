Description: A tool for Hierarchical Climate Regionalization applicable to any correlation-based clustering.
             It adds several features and a new clustering method (called, 'regional' linkage) to hierarchical 
             clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): data regridding, coarsening spatial resolution,
             geographic masking (by continents, regions, or countries), data filtering by mean and/or variance 
             thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function
             with preliminary big data support, different clustering methods, hybrid hierarchical clustering, 
             multi-variate clustering (MVC), cluster validation, and visualization of region maps.
